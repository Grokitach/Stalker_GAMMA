## Gameplay Changes
### Gun Repair System Streamlining
- Guns do not have %-based conditions anymore.
- Gun parts can be repaired in the same manner outside and inside a given gun: parts above 60% can be cleaned using cleaning kits ; parts below 60% can be repaired using a gun repair kit.
- Gun parts can be repaired within guns with the right-click > maintenance > clean/repair part X like before.
- Gun lubes, gun sprays, ramrods and files are now used as crafting materials for gun cleaning and repair kits.
- Parts within a gun degrade when shooting.
- Guns now display the "Jam Chance Probability" stat which is based on the parts condition.

### Accurate %-based defense values
- The defense values are now displayed as % in the inventory screen instead of meaningless bars.
- Defense values caps are also displayed (maximum resistance).
- All the discrepencies between item cards and actual defense values used by the damage reduction formula are fixed - but for the radiation resistances (will fix later, radiation res is complex to display as it corresponds to a reduction in radiation levels per second).

### Belt Items 2.0
- Complete rework of all stats of all belt items: Artefacts, Pelts and Tech items.
- Only one pelt can be equipped at a time.
- Pelt conditions depend on the knives you have in your inventory. Pelts condition range is indicated in each knife stats. Upgrading your knife is now really important to get the best stats for your pelts.
- Pelts are x4 more common than before.
- Tech items upgrade recipes rebalance.
- Artefacts values are tiered in 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% etc increments. Negatives have been reworked to use new mechanics such as positive / negative bleed recovery, positive / negative radiation resistance, positive / negative carry weight, on top of the classic resistances. For more information see  the paragraph below and see the following Miro board: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKaB9zO4=/?share_link_id=535823804635

### Artefacts Remake
- Artefacts do not emit radiations anymore. Instead, some artefacts reduce radiation resistance, some others increase radiation resistances. This stat works the same way as helmet and armor radiation resistance.
- Artefacts now increase resistances cap: all defenses are capped at 65% maximum damage reduction. By using specific artefacts builds, the player can reach 95% resistance and caps in for certain damage types.
- Removal of the artefacts containers.
- Artefacts crafting remade: all recipes need mutant parts and artefacts. T0 > T1 and T1 > T2 artefacts crafting only require one artefact. T2 > T3 and T3 > T4 require two artefacts and mutant parts.
- Removed artefacts melter charges for crafting recipes.
- Artefacts South > North spawn gradient has been remade: T3 and T2 artefacts will be harder to find in general.
- Artefacts spawn logic brought back to vanilla behavior: artefacts type spawn in relation with the Anomalies type (fire in fire, etc).
- Artefacts take longer and longer to spawn while staying in a given map: artefacts spawn frequency is high when entering a map, and is progressively reduced while remaining in a given map. When moving to another map, the frequency is high again and gradually decreases...
- An equipped detector will passively indicate if nearby artefacts are detectable with a status icon. This can be disabled in MCM.

### Bleed System Rebalance
- Bleed power has been increased by a large margin: bleeds are now extremely dangerous and can kill you in seconds.
- Bleeds are much more random: each hit will not trigger a hit.
- Bleed power depends on your health after being hit: if you get hit and have only few HP left, the bleed damages will be low compared to surviving a hit with a lot of health.
- Bandages bleed reduction is happening over time instead of being instant: you need to upgrade bandages to tourniquets to properly heal strong bleeds. Sometimes it is better to use a red medkit and then a bandage to recover from a bleed.
- Positive bleeding recovery artefacts build will quickly remove bleeding without the need of medical items while positive passive healing artefacts will greatly help stabilizing the bleed damages and allow fast health recovery during combat. 

### Armor Rebalance - baby steps
- Slight armor rebalance to address the most broken armors.
- Generally reduced endgame ballistic resistances
- Increased radiation resistances of scientific armors
- More af slot for all armors
- Proto Exos now need Heavy Repair kits instead of Exo Repair kits.
- Altyn ballistic resistance has been improved, as well as its telepatic protection, but the rad res has been reduced

### Remade all NPCs Loadouts based on a new high-quality gun list of over 150+ guns
- Took advantage of the new npc loadouts weight system by TD to carefully set weapons rarity and differiante Factions identity even more.
- If you think some powerful guns are too common, tell me.
- Edited chances for scopes, gl and silencers to spawn on guns to be lower than before.

### Smaller changes
- Heavy Metal Magazines replace Porn mags
- Magazines, Cards and Journals allow to pass time
- Radiations cannot reduce your stamina to 0, only to 15% max (walk only)
- Bread Artefact is replaced by a bolt: this should allow a better on boarding for new players.
- Bolt packs only give bolts
- Axe to vision slot + Increased axe hit distance and splash radius
- Quick knife can't be used while being equipped with a melee item
- Display of Melee weapons damage and penetration stats
- NPCs detect disguised player more easily
- Removal of Electric Anomalies blue screen effect
- Doubled electric anomalies accumulation time (easier to throw bolt > runthrough)
- Increased electro mines radius

***

## Gunplay Changes
- 3DSS added for all guns thanks to the painstaking work of Andtheherois and the amazing code from Redotix.
- Snipers have +5 AP.
- Snipers aim down sight speed is much faster.
- Some heavy guns aim down sight speed is much slower.
- Exo armors reduce guns enhanced recoil effects.
- 7.62x39 damage increased from 40 to 45.
- Reduced 9x39 ammo box size from 15 to 12 (more expensive, harder to craft).
- Reduced Slugs damage to actor to avoid double shotgun one shot early on.
- MP5SD recoil reduce and accuracy increase: it is now one of the best 9x19 SMG.
- Reduced MP9 accuracy (was too high) increased RPM.
- Glock Hornet fixed and recoil reduced.
- Benelli and MP155 as C tier.
- BAS MP153/155 removed.
- Desert Eagle has a proper muzzle climb effect when shooting continuously.
- USP 45 Tactical added (9x19 top of the line guns are too crowded).
- SIG226 upgrade kit is now sold by T1 NATO traders.
- AN-94 initial hyperburst in full auto
- Weapon Cover Tilt offset update: short guns should be able to be moved closer to the walls without triggering the tilt.
- .338 federal as proper hunting round
- Deer hunter as 338 Federal

***

## Progression Changes
- Traders buy items above 5% condition instead of 50%.
- New repeatable and non-repeatable quests thanks to iTheon New Task addon. This includes some multi-step quests.
- The Brainscorcher and the Miracle Machine should both be disabled to be able to progress to the North. Artefacts and anti psi drugs will not be able to protect you against the scorcher Psi-barrier.
- The Radar map and the Brainscorcher have been made a bit easier (less monolithans, less powerful monolithans).
- Progressive toolkits: your first yellow stash will always spawn a basic toolkit if it spawns a toolkit. Then your next stashes will be able to spawn an advanced kit. Then your next stashes will be able to spawn an expert kit: you can't have an advanced toolkit super early. This will also address to some extent the North factions progression (monolith, sin etc).
- T3 and T4 artefacts recipes can only be bought from the North Ecologist traders.
- Lv 1 NVG is harder to craft and can't be bought
- Scientific Detector from Grizzly Detector, no more elite detector
- Marsh Scientist field task rewards random artefacts instead of Lead Box
- Jupiter task rewards a random artefact instead of a lead box
- Easier Swamp CS storyline military and renegades squads
- +8kg base weight to better manage early game
- removal of survival kit in starting loadouts
- PSUs recipes don't need AAMs anymore
- Knives influence mutant condition parts
- Added antibio chlor sulfad and antiemetic to NPCs lootpools
- Yellow stashes probability = 50% instead of 99%
- Number of tasks to complete for yellow stash 8 -> 7
- Removed the option to trade Groza for Groza Storm at Nimble
- Radar stashes doesn't drop expert toolkits (this is to prevent AW farming early and before completing the brainscorcher).
- ISG MP5SD start cost increase
- Enemies in Agroprom Underground should now respawn: this should trigger a new sakharov task.
- No more knot, seraphim and bat in RF packages

***

## Audio Changes
- Oleh's Weapon Sound Tweaks For GAMMA v2.7 (better guns sounds for actor and NPCs, better match between animation and sound timings, etc). Oleh is the GOAT.
- Bullet and Grenade Impact Sounds: the sounds will change based on the material bullets and grenades enter in colision with.
- GAMMA WPO Jam Player Voice FIX by MrShersh.
- Fixed melee on mutants hit sounds.
- Reduced chance for voiced actor kill confirm.
- Changed shotguns suppressed sounds.

***

## Graphics Changes
- Diolator Grizzly detector texture
- Pulse anomalies brightness fix

***

- Removed the random decrease of lucifer condition on level transition
- Animation scripts update
- Free Zoom fixes
