        <text>You just used an item to heal yourself. However healing in GAMMA is a bit more complex than just using medkits.\n \n
         • Your health is divided in several individual health pools:\n
		 	 | - Main Health (character icon). \n
		 	 | - Individual limbs health. \n
		 	 | - Psy health. \n
		 • You die if your Main Health reaches 0, if your Head Health reaches 0, if your Torso Health reaches 0 or if your Psy Health reaches 0.\n
		 • The Legs and Arms bars have various effects when being depleted: \n
		 	 | - Damaged arms make your aim shake. \n
		 	 | - Damaged legs slow you down and deals damage to your Main Health when running on a broken leg. \n

        <text>• Main Health can be healed using items which display a red heart icon, this mainly includes: \n
			 	 | - Medkits  (slow health recovery). \n
			 	 | - Stimpacks (fast health recovery). \n
			 	 | - Artefacts, Pelts and Belt Items with passive health regeneration properties. \n  \n

			  • The higher the rank of the Medkit or the Stimpack, the better the health recovery.  \n

    <string id="ui_gamma_tutorial_heal_card_03_description">
        <text>%c[ui_white]• Limb health pools contain two types of health:\n
				| - %c[d_orange]Temporary Limb Health%c[ui_white] (in yellow), which gradually reduces with time.\n
				| - %c[ui_gray_2]Permanent Limb Health%c[ui_white] (in white).\n
			  • %c[d_orange]Temporary Limb Health%c[ui_white] is restored  with using First-Aid items displaying a red heart icon, like Bandages, Medkits, Stimpacks...\n
			  • %c[d_orange]Temporary Limb Health%c[ui_white] can be converted to %c[ui_gray_2]Permanent Limb Health%c[ui_white] using Post-Heal items displaying a white heart icon, like Yadulin, Antidote, Ibuprofen... \n
			  • Limbs Health restoration thus works by using a First-Aid item (ex: Bandage) followed by a Post-Heal item (ex: Ibuprofen).\n
			  • The details of %c[d_orange]Temporary Limb Health%c[ui_white] restoration and %c[ui_gray_2]Permanent Limb Health%c[ui_white] conversion for each item is detailed in the item description. \n
			  • The %c[d_orange]Temporary Limb Health%c[ui_white] is consumed before the %c[ui_gray_2]Permanent Limb Health%c[ui_white]. Thus, during fights, simply use bandages until the fight ends, and then convert the %c[d_orange]Temporary Limb Health%c[ui_white] to %c[ui_gray_2]Permanent Limb Health%c[ui_white].\n

        <text>Bleeding
		</text>
    </string>

    <string id="ui_gamma_tutorial_heal_card_04_description">
        <text>• When receiving damages, there's a probability that the fresh wounds bleed. Bleeding is indicated by a blood droplet icon on the HUD. The stronger the bleed, the more red the icon outline will be (white > yellow > red).\n \n

			  • Bleeds must be treated fast since they aggravate and deal a lot of damage overtime. They can be treated using: \n 
				 	 | - Bandage (slow bleed heal). \n
				 	 | - Tourniquet (fast bleed heal). \n
				 	 | - Artefacts, Pelts and Belt Items passive bleed heal properties. \n \n
					
			  • Certain artefacts have negative bleed recovery, that needs to be counter balanced with positive bleed recovery, otherwise any bleed will quickly aggravate.\n
