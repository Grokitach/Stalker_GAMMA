		• Certain areas of the Zone contain working vehicles, namely: Darkscape, Jupiter, Zaton, and CNPP. Vehicles cannot be moved from one map to another.\n \n
		
		• You can approach driveable vehicles such as cars, trucks or tractors and press the "Use" action (F by default) to enter the vehicle.\n \n

		• You then need to press the "Detector" key (6 by default) to turn the engine on. There is no fuel management, however the vehicles can be damaged and can explode. Thus, avoid using them as covers.\n \n

		• Be careful to avoid entering into anomalies while driving, as this will likely be your end.\n \n
