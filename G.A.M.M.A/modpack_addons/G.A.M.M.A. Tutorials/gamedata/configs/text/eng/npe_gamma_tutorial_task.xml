		• Welcome to the Zone, stalker. Tutorials will be given to you throughout your adventure depending on your actions. Tutorials can be skipped by accessing the Main Menu &gt; Mod Configuration Menu &gt; NPE Modules and ticking boxes within each module (white box = disabled).\n \n

		• Your progression within the Zone depend on the Tasks that you accept from stalkers. These can be started by talking to regular stalkers, or by accessing your PDA &gt; %c[pda_red]Taskboard%c[ui_white], where you can %c[pda_red]Refresh%c[ui_white] the nearby available tasks and accept them.\n \n 	

		• There are several %c[d_yellow]Storylines%c[ui_white] as well, which can be accessed by talking to %c[d_cyan]Important Characters%c[ui_white], or %c[d_cyan]Traders%c[ui_white] that appear on your PDA Map. %c[d_yellow]Storylines%c[ui_white] will appear as yellow quest markers on your PDA once accepted.\n \n

		• G.A.M.M.A. is hard, and Hard Survivalist difficulty is meant for people already knowing G.A.M.M.A. quite well.
