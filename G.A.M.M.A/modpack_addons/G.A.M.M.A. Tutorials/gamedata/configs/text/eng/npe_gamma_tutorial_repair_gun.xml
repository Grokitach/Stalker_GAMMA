		 • You just looted your first gun, congratulations. However it might not be readily useable considering the gun's parts condition. Each part has a color depending on its condition, and each part has an effect on the gun performance:\n
		  | - Barrel condition affects bullets damage and armor penetration. It is the most critical part of gun.\n
		  | - Internal parts condition affect the chance of jamming. \n \n
		 
		 • A 9x18 pistol in good condition is thus better than a rifle with a damaged barrel.\n \n
		 
		 • Focusing on looting guns with a green condition barrel is of paramount importance to progress fast. However, any gun can easily be repaired with the right tools.

		 • By looting enemies, stashes or random loot scattered across the Zone, you will find gun parts in various conditions.\n \n
		 
		 • You can simply drag and drop these parts on a gun to swap them. The barrel cannot be swapped however.\n \n
		
		 • This does not require any tool, workbench, or anything. Just drag and drop the parts.

		 • If a part condition is above or equal to 60%, you need to buy or craft a cleaning kit of the same type as the gun (A, B, C or D).\n
		
		 • To clean a part within a gun: right-click the gun &gt; maintenance &gt; clean part &gt; the part will be at 100% condition.\n
		
         • Additionally, parts can be repaired from the inventory by doube-clicking a repair kit and selecting the part to repair.\n
		
         • Cleaning kits can all be bought from any Mechanic trader right from the start.\n
		
		 • Guns with a green condition barrel are thus extremely valuable: they can be easily repaired to deal full damage by using a single cleaning kit that you can buy anywhere.

		 • Repair kits are extremely powerful tools, but only Type A repair kits are readily available from Mechanic traders from the start, allowing repairs of any pistol and most SMGs.\n \n
		
		 • You need to visit rare stashes to get toolkits that will allow you to buy or craft new repair kits. These stashes are depicted by big yellow icons on the map and are rewarded from tasks. \n \n
		
		 • The more to the north of the Zone the stash is, the higher the chance to get a better toolkit is. \n \n
		
         • The Toolkits &gt; Repair kit crafting correspondance is the following: \n
            • Basic toolkit &gt; Type B repair kit. \n
            • Advanced toolkit &gt; Type C repair kit. \n
            • Expert toolkit &gt; Type D repair kit.\n \n
