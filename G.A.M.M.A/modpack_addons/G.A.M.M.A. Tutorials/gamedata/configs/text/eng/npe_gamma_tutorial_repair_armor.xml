        <text>%c[ui_white]You just looted your first armor, congratulations. However it might not be readily useable. Let's learn how to repair it.\n \n
		
		• Holding LeftCtrl while hovering your mouse on an armor shows its stats at 100% condition. This is useful for allowing you to judge the qualities of the armor before repairing it.\n \n
		
		• To repair armors below 50% you need an armor %c[242,53,227,255]Repair Kit%c[ui_white] and swap its parts using %c[yellow]Spare Parts%c[ui_white] in good condition at a workbench. %c[242,53,227,255]Repair Kit%c[ui_white] are locked behind %c[d_orange]Toolkits%c[ui_white]\n \n
		
		• To maintain amors that are at or above 65%, you need armor %c[d_blue]Maintenance Kits%c[ui_white] such as sewing kits and glues, which can be further helped using %c[pda_green]Supportive Materials%c[ui_white].\n \n
		
		• Helmets are repaired and maintained the same way.\n \n</text>

    <string id="ui_gamma_tutorial_repair_armor_card_02_description">
        <text>%c[242,53,227,255]Repair Kit%c[ui_white] can be used at workbenches to swap armor parts using %c[yellow]Spare Parts%c[ui_white], preferably in good condition. The resulting armor condition is based on the average of all parts. Swapping parts does not consume %c[242,53,227,255]Repair Kit%c[ui_white] charges.\n \n
		
		• Each armor belongs to an armor class (indicated on the armor icon). Each class has a corresponding armor repair kit: Light, Medium, Heavy, Exo.\n \n

		• These %c[242,53,227,255]Repair Kit%c[ui_white] can be crafted with the appropriate %c[d_orange]Toolkits%c[ui_white] and components, following the relation detailled below:
		 | - Basic Toolkit > Light Armor Repair Kit\n
		 | - Advanced Toolkit > Medium Armor Repair Kit (and Heavy).\n
		 | - Expert Toolkit > Heavy and Exo Armor Repair Kit. To be able to craft an exo repair kit you need to find the crafting recipe for it first. \n \n

		• %c[d_orange]Toolkits%c[ui_white] can be obtained from Yellow Stashes, which are given after accomplishing tasks.\n \n

		• Armor Repair Kits can be used to repair armor above 50% using the same method as %c[d_blue]Maintenance Kits%c[ui_white] (detailled after). Doing so uses one charge of the %c[242,53,227,255]Repair Kit%c[ui_white].\n \n       </text>

        <text>%c[ui_white]• %c[yellow]Spare Parts%c[ui_white] can be repaired before accessing the workbench by using various repair items in your inventory. To know which items need to be used to repair a part, you can right click the part and left click on details.\n \n
			  
			  • Alternatively hovering a %c[yellow]Spare Parts%c[ui_white] highlights the repair item needed which is available in your inventory.\n \n
			  
			  • To repair a %c[yellow]Spare Parts%c[ui_white], right click the associated repair item and left click on "use". Then proceed to the repair of the %c[yellow]Spare Parts%c[ui_white].\n \n
              
			  • %c[yellow]Spare Parts%c[ui_white] that are below 50% cannot be repaired. They can be useful to make quick bucks by selling them to mechanics however (you will not become rich this way though).\n \n</text>
