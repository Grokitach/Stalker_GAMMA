		%c[ui_gray_1]A set of specialized brushes which can be used to clean the barrel and other parts of a firearm from dirt, sand, moisture, lubricant residues and other foreign materials that have accumulated during use. Such sets are quite commonly used in the Zone in order to keep firearms in a good shape at all times. It is possible to utilize common tools to have a better access to inner mechanisms of a gun or alcohol to more easily dissolve oil residue. Can also be used to better spread gun oil, however a more cost-efficient method used by most experienced stalkers entails the application of animal fat on the brushes as an alternative lubricant. This particular set has certain deep-penetrating solvents and specially shaped brushes that allow a user to clean very internally complicated weapons, as well as clean precision rifles without affecting their accuracy. Manufacturer unknown, but its simple design and construction as well as very high quality materials used suggest a military, presumably special forces origin.\n \n
