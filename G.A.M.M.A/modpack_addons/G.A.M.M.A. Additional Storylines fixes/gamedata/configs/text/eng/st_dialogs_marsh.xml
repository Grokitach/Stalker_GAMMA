		<text>I found a flight recorder.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="find_blackbox_mlr_reward_csky_1">
		<text>Ah, an excellent find! Perhaps we'll finally find the cause of these air raids in the marshes.</text>

<!-- Librarian (Clear Sky Barman) -->
	<string id="story_b_cs_0">
		<text>What can you tell me about Cold?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_1">
		<text>What can I say? He's earned quite a bit of respect as the current leader of our organization.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_2">
		<text>How did he earn that respect?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_3">
		<text>You see, there was some controversy regarding Lebedev, our former leader - who, by the way, I personally never met - and he didn't seem to take the opinions of the faction members into account during their crusade towards the CNPP. That mercenary certainly helped us out, but in the end, it just wasn't worth it. Those who remained at the base were unable to fight back against a resurgence made by the Renegades. The significance of our struggle in the swamps was reduced to zero... and the sacrifices on the way to the Chernobyl NPP, as well as the swamps, turned out to be in vain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_4">
		<text>It seems like the faction's resentment towards their leader at that time was justified.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_5">
		<text>There's more to it... After our troops had returned, we had to start a long war to take everything back. We wouldn't be able to manage in day-to-day life without Cold. He received some help from unaffiliated stalkers and got in touch with people throughout the Garbage and the Cordon. Free stalkers helped us out, and having a charismatic leader certainly didn't hurt. Moreover, he's given an order to all fighters - without exceptions - not to leave here. We'll take any help, but we won't risk the lives of our guys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_6">
		<text>Whoever Lebedev was and what he did, you aren't the same faction you used to be.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_7">
		<text>That's your opinion. Certainly has some value to it. Right now, we have no large-scale goals, except for maybe...er... Anyway, it's probably time we cut the storytelling and start the trading.</text>

	<string id="story_dog_0">
		<text>Whose pseudodog is that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_1">
		<text>That's Buddy, the Doctor's dog. Doctor asked Cold to keep him safe, as he's started getting a little old.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_2">
		<text>Well, by the looks of it, you wouldn't say that he needs it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_3">
		<text>Looks can be deceiving sometimes. This pet is a kind-hearted creature. Now, can I tell you something interesting about this kind of dog?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_4">
		<text>Go ahead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_5">
		<text>Pseudodogs don't actually descend from dogs at all, although they share the same ancient ancestor. They kind of originate from wolves - Duty learned that while researching them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_6">
		<text>And how did you come to know this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_7">
		<text>By virtue of my profession, I collect all sorts of stories. To the north, there's a place similar to our swamps called Zaton. I've heard there's an old crank that lives in the old barge, and apparently, he also has a pseudodog. Perhaps you can find out if it's true, if the distance doesn't bother you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_8">
		<text>It's only the entire length of the Zone. Maybe I'll pop over there sometime.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="about_dog_marsh_part_two_0">
		<text>I spoke to Noah - that "old crank" you mentioned earlier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_dog_marsh_part_two_1">
		<text>Oh, I completely forgot about that. So is it true - has he also tamed a pseudodog?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_dog_marsh_part_two_2">
		<text>Yeah. He calls her Lassie. She's got two puppies, and they haven't shown any kind of aggressive behaviour.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_dog_marsh_part_two_3">
		<text>Puppies? Never thought you'd ever see that in the Zone. Well, thanks - now I know that there are more friendly pseudodogs breeding in the Zone. Here are some provisions for your future journeys... And, if you need it, you can have some information about a route between the Army Warehouses and the Red Forest. It's remained with us like an echo from the past.</text>

		<text>Me? Well, I've been Clear Sky's guide for over seven years now. That said, during my earlier years, like 2011, I mostly stuck to the marshes, only rarely taking stalkers further. But that was a different time, before they found that damned mercenary in the reeds with a mouth full of swamp water.
		\nOur leaders didn't trust him - they had me blindfold him every time he wanted to enter or leave our base. And then within only a few weeks he'd somehow managed to convince them, along with most of our men, to charge into the power station.
		\nNeedless to say neither he nor much of our faction came back from that madness. All because of that fuckin' crazy merc.</text>

		<text>You're talking about Scar?</text>

	<string id="mar_csky_guide_background_3">
		<text>The legendary, yes. More than his scar I remember his creepy eyes, though. That guy was seriously freaking me out. Professor Kalancha told us that he was somehow resistant to emissions. Not just that, he got stronger each time one hit him. Had his brain fried, too. Seems like he didn't survive the giant one at the CNPP party, at any rate. Serves him right.</text>

		<text>Clear Sky is big on research, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_stalker_tech_pragmatic_research_1">
		<text>We sure are. Like the Ecologists, we keep trying to understand the Zone better but we don't just observe. We prefer to use the knowledge we gain for practical applications. For example, shards of a Gravi artefact embedded in body armour significantly reduce its weight. The bloodsucker's coagulant can be implemented in a life support system that prevents blood loss during combat. And the resolving capacity of the Flesh's eye helped us develop advanced targeting systems. That's just some of the many ideas we've come up with.</text>

	<text>This quest led many to their undoing, including dear friends of mine...\nStrelok had a group of elite stalkers, from which he is certainly the only member that is still alive.

	<string id="marsh_stalker_medic_background_0">
        <text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_background_1">
        <text>Well, I am Professor E.F. Kalancha. Alongside Lebedev and Suslov I was one of the founding members of Clear Sky. Unlike them, may they rest in peace, I stayed behind in the Hidden Base during their fateful raid on the Chernobyl NPP. I am the faction's head researcher. Most of the time I conduct experiments on artefacts, study mutant tissue samples and observe anomalies. Sometimes I cooperate with Novikov to find practical applications for the results of my work. Moreover, out of necessity I have also become the local medic. If you return injured from an excursion or, preferably, with some rare specimen in your bag, well, you know where to find me.</text>
    </string>

    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_about_people_0">
        <text>What do you think about stalkers?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_about_people_1">
        <text>Many people think they understand what the Zone truly is. Sadly, they are all mistaken. Some think it is a manifestation of pure evil, others call it a miracle, while certain people can only think of all the riches they might obtain... They are all misguided by basic human prejudices. The Zone is an incomprehensible phenomenon when viewed through the prism of human perception. Far too early for us to even try. Both stalkers and the government act recklessly in their ignorance. We did as well, once, thinking our knowledge superior to everyone else's, and paid dearly for that.</text>
    </string>

    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_about_zone_0">
        <text>What do you know about the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_about_zone_1">
        <text>Young man, we have been studying the Zone for several years now but remain none the wiser. I can tell you that the Zone is definitely not a natural phenomenon but rather the result of... a futile endeavour devised by some overly ambitious people. We are unable to reverse its effects. The Zone cannot be destroyed, nor will it disappear of its own accord. Furthermore, experience taught us that any attempt to curb or contain it will have catastrophic consequences. Presently we, Clear Sky, believe that there is only one way to reconcile man with the Zone: coexistence.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_about_zone_2">
        <text>That would be easier without emissions ravaging the area every few days. Speaking of which, what is causing them in the first place?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_about_zone_3">
        <text>How can I best explain? Let's put it like this: any complicated system in nature, and that includes the Zone, automatically seeks equilibrium in the absence of destabilizing external factors. That was the case here a few years ago - the Zone was stable and there were no significant deviations from the norm� and now? Like you have said, devastating emissions regularly sweep across the Zone. The system became unstable, distorted� a glitch, of sorts. The Zone is spewing out emission after emission and pumping itself full of energy with each one, so much so that the readings on my sensors oscillate with unbelievable speed! Unfortunately, Lebedev and Suslov were unable to reverse this trend permanently, in spite of their tragic sacrifice. The most important lesson in all this is that this "glitch" is not a product of natural causes either. This is all human handiwork.</text>
    </string>
	<string id="marsh_stalker_barman_background">
		<text>I'm the bartender. I serve drinks, food, and keep the radio playing. It's not an exciting job, but still preferable to being out in the field. Been working here for quite a few years now; got caught on the inside of the swamps when the emission hit, so I was pretty much stuck here. Headed south like most people tried to, but I was one of the few that didn't get picked off by bandits on the way. I searched out this base and joined up with Clear Sky. It was either that or die in a puddle somewhere. Spent the first few weeks as a grunt repelling the anarchists from our lookout posts and then got the job as the new bartender when Cold got promoted. Naturally, I accepted, as I'd rather be shooting drinks than bullets. But enough talk! How about a nice cold one?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_stalker_trader_background">
		<text>Spore's the name. I took over this gig about a year ago. Came to the Zone looking for wealth like everybody does and ran into a stalker called Nimble. Found out we shared a lot of the same talents: both got a lot of outside contacts, good at trafficking goods in and out of the Zone, and selling info. So when the Monolith resurgence happened and business was driven south, we followed. Managed to land myself a nice job here after Nimble recommended me to Cold. He was a member of Clear Sky back in the day, y'know? 'Course, Nimble's gone back up to Zaton to help out at the Skadovsk, the madman, but he's left me with a nice little operation here. I now have access to an army-free smuggling route through the swamps, and Clear Sky gets first pick of everything  I get my hands on. Pay Nimble a visit if you ever find yourself north of the Barrier. Even now, he's probably still peddling only the rarest weapons and armour to his fellow stalkers. For the right price, he'll set you up with some of the best damn gear in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_stalker_tech_background">
		<text>The name's Novikov, but some call me Grey. I'm the technician who keeps everything working, and the only person any good stalker goes to if their shooter starts jamming. Used to work here a long time ago until just before Cold took over. When everything went to shit, I looked for somewhere greener and got contracted by the scientists up near Jupiter. Was up there for a good few years, until one day, I heard that somehow these guys pulled through, and as soon as my contract was up, I headed back. They took me in without question; my skills with a workbench and my contacts within the scientists were sorely needed. I got us set up working with their guys so we could carry on with our old research. If you fancy the work, they're always looking for guides to the local anomalies. Talk to Spore about it if you're interested.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_stalker_leader_background">
		<text>Where do I begin? They call me Cold in these parts. I'm the leader of Clear Sky. Used to be the old drinks dispenser here a long time ago until I handed that honour over to Librarian once we caught wind of what happened to Lebedev, Suslov, and the rest of our commanders. After long and intense negotiations with the latest shipment of smuggled vodka, the local force decided that I was best suited for taking over the reins, and I've been holding on to them ever since.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_csky_history_ask1">
		<text>Tell me about Clear Sky.</text>

	<string id="marsh_csky_history_ask2">
		<text>What is it you want to know?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_csky_history_destroyed1">
		<text>Wasn't the faction destroyed?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_csky_history_destroyed2">
		<text>Almost, but we managed to pull through. While most of our guys were wiped out at the power plant, not all of us were. A good number were still in our other territories, which were later cut off from the rest of the Zone by anomalies following the emission. When it became obvious to those in the swamps at the time that they were almost trapped here with no easy way out, everything went to hell. Honest stalkers became bandits overnight, whilst the rest tried to flee to our base, or live off the area's mutants. We took on a lot of men, and our food stores ensured their loyalty, and after a little while, it became obvious we'd need a new leader. I took on the burden and asked our Librarian to man the bar in my place; he'd earned quite a name for himself in the short time since he joined. After a few months of tit-for-tat raiding with the bandits, we managed to smoke most of them out, but that didn't stop the army from feeling like they needed to move in and finish the job. Even now, they still have that bird of theirs watching the areas they took over.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_csky_history_goal1">
		<text>What's your current goal?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_csky_history_goal2">
		<text>Thing is, we don't have a single goal. Poor Lebedev was an ambitious man. He thought we could discover all of the Zone's dirty little secrets and use the knowledge to tame or contain it. That didn't exactly pan out, though. Nowadays, we do basically the same things we used to do. We hunt mutants, collect artefacts and do some research on them. We even got support from the UN to perform our own research during the Golden Age of the Zone. We got weapons, research equipments and even insights from their scientists and local Ecologists to help us out in our endeavour to uncover the secrets of the Zone. Thanks to this, every once in a while we even recover some interesting documents from old underground labs. But we don't engage in turf wars with other factions and we definitely don't plan another bold campaign into the heart of the Zone anytime soon. Unlike Duty we don't try to destroy it, and we don't want to open an amusement park here like the folks from Freedom either. For now, we coexist. Better keep a low profile, like the good ol' times before the final raid, especially in these trying times since the Monolith is back at it... It's not the Golden Age of the Zone anymore, the UN is slowly retiring and the local PMCs are challenged by that new threat. There are even rumours of a new cult that is even crazier than Monolith. But honestly, we are far from all these troubles. Better keep a low profile, as I was saying.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_csky_history_goal3">
		<text>So, Clear Sky members basically do whatever they want now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_csky_history_goal4">
		<text>In a manner of speaking. We're all like-minded people with similar interests, so the guys pretty much keep to their tasks without me actively telling them what to do all the time. Been working out well for us so far.</text>
