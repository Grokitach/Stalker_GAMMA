        <text>Here's the device.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gamajun_cs_story_dialog2_1">
        <text>Thank you, you'd better give it to the Strider. I'll stay here, and we'll secure this outpost with my boys.</text>

        <text>So you're not coming to the Swamp with me?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gamajun_cs_story_dialog2_3">
        <text>No. I'm sorry, but I'm an outcast. I can't leave my brothers behind. By the way, I promised you I'd tell you my story, so listen. In 2011, I was with Lebedev as part of an assault group breaking through Limansk. Our boss and some guys and some mercenaries moved further north, and I established myself in the city. Then there was that ejection, after which I lost my memory. According to Strider, I served the Monolith like all of them. After the events of 2012 I was myself again, waking up somewhere in the vicinity of Jupiter. I managed to survive thanks to Strider, and I became a member of his group.</text>

    <string id="gamajun_cs_story_dialog2_4">
        <text>Thank you for your story. I'll pass the device on to Strider, and I'll say hello to Cold from you.</text>

    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_0">
        <text>Is there a special job?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_1">
        <text>Come to think of it, yes. There's a war going on with the Freedom and the bandits, plus there's fanatics coming from the north. All our forces are at war, and we need hunters for our main task - to destroy the Zone. I'm offering you a job as a witch doctor. It's as simple as that: I offer you a "witch" contract, and you fulfill it and get a reward for it. How's that sound?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_2">
        <text>Sounds good. If the pay is decent, I'll take it. What's my first contract?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_3">
        <text>Don't worry about the pay, we'll pay you in money and good equipment if you prove yourself. Your first contract will be to destroy a den of bloodsuckers that have migrated south. It's a pretty big pain in the ass, the bloodsuckers have gotten past all our posts and patrols. Destroy these critters and come back for your reward. I suggest you start your search for the lair with the Butcher, he's the leader of the local hunters. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_start_4">
        <text>I'll take that contract. Consider these bloodsuckers already dead.</text>

    <string id="dolg_story_task_1_dialog_end_0">
        <text>Mission accomplished, bloodsuckers destroyed.</text>

        <text>Good job, here's your reward.</text>

        <text>So, what do I have to do to get information on Scar?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="prinesi_military_docs_start_1">
        <text>Well, here's the thing... A box with a report from one of the expeditions that went north was handed over to the roadblock from deep in the Zone. During the day they guard it as if it were filled with pure plutonium, but at night for some reason leave no more than two guards. Sneak up to the roadblock and get that box for me. And I'll spare no expense to you... within reason. You'll do it, won't you ?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="prinesi_military_docs_start_21">
        <text>I'll do it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="prinesi_military_docs_start_22">
        <text>You know, I don't think so. I value my life.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="prinesi_military_docs_start_31">
        <text>Well, I've got the money ready, but don't... don't make any noise, okay? We'd all be in for a world of hurt if the military gets pissed off.</text>

        <text>I'm looking for a certain mercenary named Scar. You know him?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cs_task3_sidor_dialog_1">
        <text>Maybe I do, but what do you need him for?</text>

        <text>He's got important information that's important to Clear Skies.</text>

    <string id="cs_task3_sidor_dialog_2">
        <text>I can sell you some information, but it'll cost you 20,000 bucks + some favors. Do some special assignment, as a sign that I can trust you, and we'll see what we know about Scar.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cs_task3_sidor_dialog_4">
        <text>Okay, I'll run one of your errands and buy the information.</text>

        <text>Not yet.</text>

        <text>Yeah, here's the money. I did my job.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="cs_task3_sidor_dialog1_4">
        <text>Well, anyway, listen, or better yet, write it down on a piece of paper, heh-heh. This mercenary came to see me. He needed some equipment for a deep raid into the northern territories. He's a pretty generous guy, spent a lot of money. From what he told me, I understand he's looking for something on Zaton. I think that's where he is now. There's also a rumor that he's holed up in the substation shops, collecting some junk. All right, good luck finding him.</text>
