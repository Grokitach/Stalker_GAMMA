		<text>The SR-25, Stoner Rifle, model 25 was developed by Reed Knight, owner of Knights Armament Co. and Eugene Stoner. The SR-25 is an AR-15 rifle scaled up to shoot 7.62x51mm NATO or .308 ammunition. 60% of parts in the rifle is interchangeable with AR-15 components. This rifle sold well among civilian shooters who needed an accurate semi-automatic rifle in 7.62x51mm NATO or .308 calibre for hunting or target shooting. This rifle also found a favour in US Military. All rifles built on the SR-25 platform share the same basic action, the AR-15/M16 system. Because of AR-15 style recoil buffer, which extends rearwards from the receiver, SR-25 cannot be fitted with a folding stock instead it is fitted with telescoping stock.\n \n
