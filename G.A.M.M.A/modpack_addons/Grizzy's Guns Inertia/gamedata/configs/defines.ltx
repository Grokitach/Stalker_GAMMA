;-- Technical item section parameters used by engine and/or scripts:

;-- release_on_first_update [bool] (setting this to true inside a section will result with releasing it from alife on loading, to prevent possible stucky animation items on player)
;-- anim_item               [bool] (indicator that a section is an animation item, to prevent it from spawning on some occassions like corpses. Those are used by NPCs, player don't need such thing)
;-- fake_ammo               [bool] (all weapon classes have ammo, even knives. We use this to prevent spawning these ammo by setting this parameter to true in their sections)
;--	icons_texture			[string] (pointing engine to use a caustom texture for icon, instead of the default "ui/ui_icon_equipment")
;-- condition_bar			[string] (pointing engine to use a caustom progression bar for item condition, instead of the default "condition_progess_bar". you can define it in "actor_menu_item.xml")
;-- power_critical			[number] (used for devices, some of them have this value for engine like detectors, while others for scripts. This is the critical power value where device stop working)
;---------------------------------------------------------------------

;-- Custom item properties:
;use[1-10]_functor	        <function> 		(function to return property name, returning nil or false will not show the property so it can be used as precondition)
;use[1-10]_action_functor	<function> 		(function to execute upon clicking on the property)
;use[1-10]_modes	        <list of strings> determines which inventory modes support the property (default is "inventory" mode, full list: inventory, loot, trade, repair)
;use[1-10]_containers       <list of strings> determines which item cell containers support the property (default is "actor_bag", full list: actor_bag, actor_equ, actor_belt, actor_trade, actor_trade_bag, npc_bag, npc_trade, npc_trade_bag)
;use[1-10]_allow_db	        <boolean> execute the action functor (as long as precondition is true) upon double clicking on the item. if an item section has many custom properties with double-click support, onlythe first one will be executed. Note that boosters have default double-click to use, so this won't work on them
