		<text>Alright, so the bad news is that nothing is going to bring this particular BTR back to life. The good news is that we won't have to. Some Military Stalkers are showing an interest in my work. It's time to get our guys equipped with some proper gear. But for me to do that, I'll need the best tools in the Zone - calibration tools. I can assign you to recover some. Are you up for that?</text>

But they'd rather kill you in cold blood than let you get out. So, my friends are stuck here.\n \nThe checkpoint guards won't let them through alive unless we bribe them with a Battery artefact. Have you heard of it? They can be found in Electro anomalies.\n \nIt's incredibly rare. I've already sent every stalker I can to find one, but no one has gotten back to me yet.
