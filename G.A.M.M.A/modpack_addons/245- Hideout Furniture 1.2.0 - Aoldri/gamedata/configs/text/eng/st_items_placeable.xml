	</string>
	<string id="st_placeable_gas_lamp_descr">
		<text>Generates light by igniting a wick doused in kerosene. Lanterns are an uncommon light source amongst stalkers as the fuel takes up weight and space in the backpacks that could otherwise be used for ammunition or priceless artefacts. Experienced stalkers that regularly travel along the path less troden make use of these lamps for their hideouts. This one has seen considerable wear over the years and appears to have lost its glass lampshade.\n \n

This particular light can be constructed in the field, though its usefulness is hampered by its conal light. Experienced stalkers use this to their advantage, illuminating potential intruders whilst maintaining their own concealment.\n \n
