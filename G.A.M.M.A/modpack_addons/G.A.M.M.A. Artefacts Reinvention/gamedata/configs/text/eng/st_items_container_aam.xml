		A small artefact formed by thermal anomalies in the Zone under extreme temperatures. The look of this artefact suggests that it was an organ of a vascular plant. Further studies showed that other organic tissues are fused deep inside.
		\nThe stem doesn't hold any useful properties. On the contrary, the small pins reduce temperature of user's body and cool all objects in their vicinity.
		\nThis artefact offers a slight psy-protection as it will resonate under the influence of psy-waves.

		This artefact is formed in anomalous zones with intense thermal activity. Actively consumes excessive heat and remains cool at all times.
		\nIt will also protect the user against electrical currents. On the other hand, exposure to such environments makes the artefact increase the conductivity due to unknown as of now mechanism. For this reason, one is forced to weigh pros and cons of Crystal when in the vicinity of areas of high conductivity.
		\nThis artefact is also highly sought for by jewellers outside the Zone as its inner core is not radioactive and considered to be of exceptional beauty if polished and refined. Only the first 1 cm of its outer layer emits radiation.
		\nIt is, however, highly advised to proceed with caution when planning to bring the artefact to the market as prolonged exposure to even minimal amounts of radioactive materials can result in death of the user. Covered with very hard layer. Relatively heavy due to high density.

		It is a spherical artefact made of red-coloured crystal, created in the Burner anomaly.
		\nIt has an unique property: it has a constant temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit/24 degrees Celsius, regardless of its surroundings. This allows it to absorb heat from its vicinity and to create a little pocket around the user which prevents the flames from damaging the body.
		\nA dangerous effect of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artefact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies.It is quite heavy due to high density of crystal-like material.

		This artefact has soft, porous, skin-like texture and is said to be able to compress. It resembles and acts like a sponge in this regard, but reveals its special characteristics only when exposed to certain external conditions.
		\nFirstly, to carry the sponge metaphor further, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from environment.
		\nSecondly, the artefact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy energy and emitting it at a small rate.

		A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artefact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralise chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Thus providing a a great level of toxic and chemical protection.
		\nIt also has a constant temperature regardless of its surroundings. This allows it to absorb heat from its vicinity and to create a little pocket around the user which prevents the flames from damaging the body. 
		\nApart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could.

		This artefact has the appearance of translucent spider webs. Just as proteinaceous spider silk, it is sticky and has properties of glue.
		\nIt can be found most commonly in or near electro anomalies and it seems to have absorbed their certain characteristics: it is able to smooth fluctuations in electric field density and acts as a weak resistor, protecting the wearer from electricity and reducing its damaging effects.

		Sponge has always been under debate among the Ecologists. Some suggest that this artefact is driven from basic form of organisms, while others believe its an advanced life form with self-awareness inherited from living creatures.
		\nDespite the theories surrounding the artefact, all can agree on one thing: it moves. The sponge sometimes tries to "grab" an object it touches. Putting it in a container might be a hard task, as if it wants to escape.

		A very small artefact of electric nature. Difficult to spot. Consists of two ring-shaped materials of organic nature, hence the given name.
		When the Ring spins, it never stops spinning, defying the first law of thermodynamics. Scientists suggest that this artefact inherits gravitational properties from Vortex anomalies.
		\nThe outer ring has a high-conductivity. It absorbs electrical current from relative sources then ground it in the inner ring. Despite the basic function, the mechanism behind the disappearance of electrical power inside the second ring is still unknown.

		This artefact resembles melted cheese interspersed with sapphire-like stones. Only yellow outer shell of the artefact appears to give off radiation and by careful processing it is possible to extract the non-radioactive blue parts for jewellery and other industrial purposes. This is due to the fact that if cleaned properly and polished, sapphire comparison becomes much more explicit: the stones are as hard and durable as this beautiful gem. This quality of theirs and their appearance make them perfect gemstones and jewellers all over the world strive to have them in stock. 
		\nThe usefulness of the artefact, however, is not limited to its industrial applications. There is scientific evidence suggesting that sapphire-like stones effectively protect from psy-waves, whereas the outer shell slightly increases resistance to toxicity.
		\nHowever, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artefact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects.
		\nDue to its density the weight of artefact has increased beyond normal standards, and thus it is one of the heaviest anomalous creations in the Zone.

		\nBecause of this mechanism, moving with an Empty is a hard task. As the gravitational field increases the density of surrounding air and slows the body down.
		\nThe real usefulness of this effect comes to the ability to reduce friction, thus obtaining great protection against physical impacts.

		Similar to Empty, this artefact consist of two disks of organic formation connected by a unique gravitational field in between. However, the said field in Full Empty is extraordinary: all atoms entering the centre, regardless of their nature, become interactive under the unknown effects of the field. Thus releasing photons (light emitting).
		\nScientists usually refer to it as the "galaxy effect", which gives the artefact an exceptional orbit of light.
		\nThe density increment of surrounding air caused by moving is higher comparing to Empty. Because of this, the artefact will greatly hinder its holder's movement.

		This glowing artefact can generate a local directed low-gravity field. Widely used by stalkers along with Gravi, a similar artefact, to increase maximum load.
		\nDue to its beautiful inner core it is highly sought after by jewellers all over the world, however it is best to proceed with caution as unskilled treatment can cause the artefact to explode with power sufficient to level a small building. It is thus highly advised to perform the polishing by means of specialised machinery, which minimises the probability of explosion. Moreover, only the outer core of the artefact emits radiation.
		\nNightstar will also absorb toxic and chemical agents from the environment, which makes it a valuable artefact for artefact hunters, although the amount of toxicity absorbed is negligible. It is, however, relatively cheap and even stalkers with pretty tight budgets can afford it if opportunity to buy it arises. 
		\nThat being said, Nightstar emits odour of burning flesh when in the closest proximity of heat source. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite.

		Direct successor to and a superior version of Gravi artefact. As was the case with Gravi, it was scientist Sakharov at Yantar who discovered its unique properties after a massive blowout/emission hit the Zone.
		\nThanks to meticulous research that followed, it was established that this new artefact is produced when three Gravi artefacts interact and get sucked into one another's singularity fields. This phenomenon is extremely rare, due to which the artefact is highly valued.
		\nIt is rumoured within Ukrainian Spetsnaz circles that in the Zone there are agents from the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation whose sole objective is acquiring and transporting Goldfish to specialised laboratories located outside of the Zone.
		\nThe artefact creates a constant anti-gravitational singularity field which affects only its closest vicinity. However, some stalkers have been known to disappear for no apparent reason leaving only a Goldfish behind.
