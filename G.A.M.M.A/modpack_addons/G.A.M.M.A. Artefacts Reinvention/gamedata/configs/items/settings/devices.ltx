;-- Device power consumption
;-------------------------
;-- Device power is basically basic item condition [value range from 0 to 1]
;-- Device power get consumed constantly on use. Once power reach a critical point (power_critical in device section), it stops functioning properly
;-- The sections below controls how much each devices consumes on different types of usages
;-- [power_consumption] allows you to set up power consumption (per frame update) if device is in hand/slot/inventory
;-- [power_consumption_event] allows you to set up power consumption if device interacted with an event (for example: geiger counter beeping on rad anomalies)
;-- Power (condition) loss = current power consumption / amper_factor
;-- "current power consumption" means that devices might loss power to different reasons (for example: Enabling both light and NV for headlamps will sum both consumption into one)

[settings]
amper_factor						= 1000	-- mA

battery							   	= batteries_dead	;-- define battery section used by devices
geiger								= detector_geiger	;-- define geiger/dosimeter section for geiger keybind

condition_critical 					= 0.05          ;-- beyond this condition, device stop functioning (this is used if device section lacks power_critical)
condition_zero 						= 0.0001        ;-- device condition on unpacking batteries
condition_full 						= 0.9999		;-- fully charged device condition

;-- 	value "p" allows related consumption type to be processed, aimed for Torch/NV in slot consumption (don't change, edit torch/NV consumption in [power_consumption_event])
