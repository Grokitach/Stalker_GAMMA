Streamlines the upgrade system by replacing all kits with generic versions.

Tired of needing to collect a bajillion upgrade kits that bloat your inventory? Not enjoying figuring out how to determine if Advanced Bootstrapping kit installs the artifact container or the sprint speed on your suit? This is the addon for you!

All basic kits have crafting recipes. The crafting recipes try to make the most of junk, so hang onto your scrap metal!

Higher tier kits (Advanced/Fine tuning) can be obtained by combining three of the previous tier. This can be done in inventory. Additionally, any higher tier kit can be downgraded into the next tier, but this is a 1:1 replacement.

Kit drops
These new kits spawn wherever the old ones spawn, randomly replacing them with a percentage chance. This chance can be tweaked in the MCM menu.
Please note that the replacement is not perfect. You may occasionally see upgrade kits blink out of existence.

- gamedata\configs\items\settings\fetch_list.ltx - removes old kits and replaces with new ones for fetch quest
