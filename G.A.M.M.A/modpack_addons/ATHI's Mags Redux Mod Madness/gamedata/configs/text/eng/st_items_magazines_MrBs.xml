		<text>
            Proprietary 10-round (or 9+1) magazine for AUG rifles. Made of a translucent polymer. Made in Austria. \n
			\nNot sure who has had interest in importing “California legal” magazines into the Zone but like anything gun related they will surely find a use here. On the plus side, they fit into small pockets.
