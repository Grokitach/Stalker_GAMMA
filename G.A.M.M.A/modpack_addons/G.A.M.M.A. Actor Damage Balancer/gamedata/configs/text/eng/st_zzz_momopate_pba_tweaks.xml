	<string id="st_af_sandstone_descr">
		<text>An artefact found in extreme temperature anomalies. It seems to have sentience due to being observed as seemingly knowing when its owner takes the life of another living being, instating a hormonal rush in the owner that pushes them into a combat frenzy. These effects may include superhuman stamina, reflexes and even regenerative capabilities. Scientists can't explain this artefact's weird connection with its user and the Noosphere at the same time. \n</text>
