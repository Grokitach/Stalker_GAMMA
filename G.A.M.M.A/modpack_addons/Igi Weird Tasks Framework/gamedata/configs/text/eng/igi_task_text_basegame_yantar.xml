I know zoologists won't favour this, but this place is not a zoo, one has to admit. In any case, make sure you return to me as soon as you have the required sample - it could provide valuable insight into the biology of mutant wildlife!</text>

Please, go to the cache at these coordinates: if you hurry, the documents I wish to recover should still be there.

		<text>Oh, sure. HQ notified us of tools arriving at our bunker via the Cordon, but the package never made it. And where did this delivery end up? Only the Zone knows. However, the situation hasn't changed, and we still need more tools. HQ is real obstinate about organising more for us right now, so I'll tell you what. If you manage to find some tools out in the wild - even some basic ones - I'll personally pay you to bring them back here. </text>

He wanted me to tell you he's set aside a healthy sum of roubles for the stalker who can bring me a set of expert tools.
