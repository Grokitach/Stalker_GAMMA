## Description

G.A.M.M.A. stands for Gigantic Automated Modular Modpack for Anomaly. This modpack for the 100% free and standalone STALKER Anomaly changes *every* aspect of the game, from the entire economy to the minute detail statistic of every gun and artefact.

From a technical point of view, the main motivation behind this project is to provide an easy to install, automatically updated and modular modding platform for Stalker Anomaly. From a gameplay point of view, the default parameters and mods activated with G.A.M.M.A. aim at providing a balanced survival, scavenging, cooking, crafting and repairing focused experience with a streamlined gameplay. GAMMA aims at creating a meaningful and enjoyable sense of progression in the sandbox Chernobyl Exclusion Zone of STALKER Anomaly.

The sense of progression in GAMMA is achieved through different aspects, that you can customise to some extent:
- The more to the north you go, the more dangerous the Zone is (stronger stalkers, stronger mutants, more deadly anomalies, stronger radiations) but the better are the rewards (better gear, better toolkits, better artefacts).
- Gear acquisition is locked behind getting toolkits that are obtained by visiting rare stashes acquired by accomplishing several maps.
- Guns with green barrels will deal full damage and just need few parts of good quality to stop jamming (without the need of toolkits or repair kits).
- The gear you find on enemies need to be repaired using repair kits crafted using toolkits.
- The artefacts you find are immediately useable but need to be empowered by combining artefacts to achieve higher protection levels (using a specific tool buyable at Ecologists).
- Access to the North of the Zone is locked behind completing the Miracle Machine and the Brain Scorcher.
- GAMMA removes all gear trading, meaning you cannot buy or sell weapons or armor.
- GAMMA removes random stash loot, so you can't just run to the meta stashes and have endgame equipment instantly.
- The healing system uses multiple body parts that get damaged individually and that you heal by using first-aid kits/bandages/stimpacks followed by post-heal items such as antibiotics, antidotes, painkillers, and anti-inflammatory drugs. 
- GAMMA completely revamps the STALKER Anomaly graphics, gun models, animations, A-life, Combat AI and much more thanks to the many mods made by the community.

This modpack is 100% copyright free since it redistributes little to no copyrighted content developed by other modders. Indeed, G.A.M.M.A. downloads every add-on directly from moddb or github, and installs them automatically. You will thus directly support modders by installing G.A.M.M.A. On top of this, each addon original source (moddb or github page) is directly accessible from the Mod Organizer 2 instance by right-clicking addons > visit moddb.com.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. G.A.M.M.A. is a fan-created modification for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, developed and wholly owned by GSC Game World. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. G.A.M.M.A. is not an official product of GSC Game World and is a derivative work based on their S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.

You can support GSC by buying the original games here (although, they are not needed to play GAMMA):

GAMMA is a large project using the work of many talented modders, and each and everyone one of them are contributing to making Stalker Anomaly a better experience. You can check the entire modlist, modder names and mod pages link used by GAMMA here:

I would like to thank all the modders involved in this project by making all the GAMMA addons free to use, edit and repost with modifications as long as the source is indicated (original addon author, from Stalker GAMMA). For numbered addons (105-), original authors must be contacted before repost and modifications. Repost of unmodified individual parts of this project are not recommended and may harm the community in the long run because updates happen quite often in this repository and it is thus better to directly post links to the relevant files stored here.


## Other Projects

I also made a modpack for Dragon's Dogma 2 called "Dragon's Dogamma", for which I notably remade the entire gear looting system to put more emphasis on exploration and boss hunting instead of buying gear from shops: https://github.com/Grokitach/Dragons-Dogamma
